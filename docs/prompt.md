  How to Resume on Another System

  1. Open the doc:
  cat /Users/otakutekkurai/repos/claims/voice-lab/docs/01-voice-agent-architecture.md
  2. Copy the prompt from the "How to Continue This Conversation" section
  3. Paste it into a new Claude conversation
  4. I'll read the doc and pick up exactly where we left off

  ---
  The prompt includes:
  - What exercises you've completed
  - What's remaining
  - How we're working (you type, I explain)
  - The reminder about STT/TTS topics

  ---
  Want to continue now with Exercise 6 (WebRTC VAD), or are you switching systems?

  ---
  Reminder: After audio fundamentals, we'll cover STT/TTS integration patterns and
  interruption/turn-taking mechanics.
